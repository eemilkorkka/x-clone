# X-clone

A fully responsive full-stack clone of X (formerly known as Twitter) built using technologies like Next.js, tailwindcss, Radix UI, MySQL, Appwrite Storage for storing videos & images and NextAuth for authentication. 

I decided to build this project to learn about more about Next.js and full-stack web development.
